    'discord' => [
        'token' => 'YOUR_API_TOKEN',
    ],

5. Add the bot to your server and identify it by running the artisan command:

## üßê How to use

- Make a post request (example: http://localhost:8000/api/send):
- The "message" attribute generates a simple text message.
- The "embed" attribute is an object and each attribute is responsible for generating an [embed](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-object).
- The "channel_id" attribute is the id of the channel where you want to send the message. 
```bash
$ curl -d '{
  "message": "",
  "embed": {
    "title": "Embed Title",
    "type": "rich",
    "description": "content embed",
    "color": "777",
    "timestamp": "2022-04-18T22:42Z"
  },
  "channel_id": "000000000000"
}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8000/api/send

```
